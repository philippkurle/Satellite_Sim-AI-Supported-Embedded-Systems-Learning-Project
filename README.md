# Satellite_Sim - AI-Assisted Embedded Systems Learning Project

This repository documents Satellite_Sim, a simplified satellite subsystem simulator I built on an Arduino Mega.

## Context

I started this project as a self-directed semester-break learning project after I was unable to take an assistant position in a university lab, as I had originally planned.
The goal was to gain hands-on experience in embedded systems, hardware integration, and system-oriented thinking. I hoped to achieve this by developing a simplified satellite subsystem simulator on an Arduino Mega.
The software implementation was heavily AI-assisted, as I had only very limited knowledge of C++ and object-oriented programming when I started the project.

## Project Overview

Satellite_Sim simulates a simplified satellite system where subsystem behavior and availability are determined by the simulated energy input from the photovoltaic (PV) solar cell.

The Arduino Mega is powered from a 5 V USB power bank, as well as the micro servo, which is supplied separately from an additional 5 V output. The solar cell is not used as the primary power source for the controller, but its measured voltage is used as a proxy for available solar energy. I implemented a 10 kΩ / 10 kΩ voltage divider to halve the applied PV voltage. By that, I reduced the risk of damaging the Arduino´s analog pins. The solar cell produced approximately 5.12 V during testing under direct sun exposure.

Based on the measured PV voltage, as well as the simulated leak status from the water-level sensor, the system operates in one of three modes:

- **NOMINAL** - normal operation with full system availability
- **WARN** - limited operation and decreased duty-cycle telemetry
- **SAFE** - safety-oriented system behavior with strict duty-cycle telemetry

These modes determine which subsystems will remain responsive and how they react.

### Main Subsystems

- **Mode Control**
  Sets the current system mode (**NOMINAL**, **WARN**, or **SAFE**) based on PV voltage thresholds and the simulated leak input from the water-level sensor.
  
- **Sensors**
  The solar cell is used to monitor input voltage, while the water-level sensor is used to simulate a leak condition that can influence mode policy.
   
- **User Interface (UI)**
  A 16x2 I²C LCD displays relevant system information such as PV voltage, leak status, security state, and entered PIN. A buzzer generates a periodic safe-beacon signal in **SAFE** mode, and a traffic light module displays the current system mode (**green = NOMINAL**, **yellow = WARN**, and **red = SAFE**).
  
- **Security**
  The security subsystem uses four states: **WAIT_RFID**, **WAIT_CODE**, **LOCKOUT**, and **AUTH_OK**. Security access is granted in two stages: first through RFID authentication, then through PIN entry. If the entered PIN is correct, the system transitions to **AUTH_OK**. After three failed PIN attempts, the system enters **LOCKOUT**.
  
- **Actuator Control**
  If the security state is set to **AUTH_OK** and the system is currently operating in **NOMINAL** mode, then the micro servo performs a short movement to simulate an actuator response. 

## My Contribution

I focused on:

- defining the project concept and simplifying the satellite system idea
- selecting components and assembling the physical hardware prototype
- using AI as a tool to generate, refine, and iterate on the software implementation
- testing hardware behavior and debugging the software with AI support
- documenting the system structure, hardware setup, and project context
- analyzing, annotating, and learning key parts of the software implementation

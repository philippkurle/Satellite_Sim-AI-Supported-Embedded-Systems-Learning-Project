# Satellite_Sim - AI-Assisted Embedded Systems Learning Project

This repository documents Satellite_Sim, a simplified satellite subsystem simulator I built on an Arduino Mega.

## Context

I started this project as a self-directed semester-break learning project after I was unable to take an assistant position in a university lab, as I had originally planned.
The goal was to gain hands-on experience in embedded systems, hardware integration, and system-oriented thinking. I hoped to achieve this by developing a simplified satellite subsystem simulator on an Arduino Mega.
The software implementation was heavily AI-assisted, as I had only very limited knowledge of C++ and object-oriented programming when I started the project.

## Project Overview

Satellite_Sim simulates a simplified satellite system where subsystem behavior and availability are determined by the simulated energy input from the photovoltaic (PV) solar cell.

The Arduino Mega is powered from a 5 V USB power bank, as well as the micro servo, which is supplied separately from an additional 5 V output. The solar cell is not used as the primary power source for the controller, but its measured voltage is used as a proxy for available solar energy. I implemented a 10 kΩ / 10 kΩ voltage divider to halve the applied PV voltage. By that, I reduced the risk of damaging the Arduino´s analog pins. The solar cell produced approximately 5.12 V during testing under direct sun exposure.

Based on the measured PV voltage, as well as the simulated leak status from the water-level sensor, the system operates in one of three modes:

- **NOMINAL** - normal operation with full system availability
- **WARN** - limited operation and decreased duty-cycle telemetry
- **SAFE** - safety-oriented system behavior with strict duty-cycle telemetry

These modes determine which subsystems will remain responsive and how they react.

### Main Subsystems

- **Mode Control**
  Sets the current system mode (**NOMINAL**, **WARN**, or **SAFE**) based on PV voltage thresholds and the simulated leak input from the water-level sensor.
  
- **Sensors**
  The solar cell is used to monitor input voltage, while the water-level sensor is used to simulate a leak condition that can influence mode policy.
   
- **User Interface (UI)**
  A 16x2 I²C LCD displays relevant system information such as PV voltage, leak status, security state, and entered PIN. A buzzer generates a periodic safe-beacon signal in **SAFE** mode, and a traffic light module displays the current system mode (**green = NOMINAL**, **yellow = WARN**, and **red = SAFE**).
  
- **Security**
  The security subsystem uses four states: **WAIT_RFID**, **WAIT_CODE**, **LOCKOUT**, and **AUTH_OK**. Security access is granted in two stages: first through RFID authentication, then through PIN entry. If the entered PIN is correct, the system transitions to **AUTH_OK**. After three failed PIN attempts, the system enters **LOCKOUT**.
  
- **Actuator Control**
  If the security state is set to **AUTH_OK** and the system is currently operating in **NOMINAL** mode, then the micro servo performs a short movement to simulate an actuator response.

## What I Learned

This project gave me first-hand exposure on topics such as setting up and integrating Arduino hardware, reading AI-assisted C++ code beyond my skill level and debugging complex embedded systems.

### Embedded Hardware

- Built and tested functional circuits that combined several electronic components into a working prototype.
- Learned how to evaluate unfamiliar hardware experimentally. For example, I tested the water-level sensor with a short Arduino script to determine whether its output behaved as an analog or digital signal.
- Improved my understanding of how sensors, displays, and actuators are connected to and controlled by a microcontroller.
- Learned to account for electrical limits in the hardware design. To keep the PV input voltage within a safe measurement range for the Arduino Mega, I used a 10 kΩ / 10 kΩ voltage divider before feeding the signal into an analog input. This taught me that sensor integration is not only about code, but also about ensuring that electrical signals are safe and measurable.
- Gained practical experience with power distribution. The micro servo was supplied through a separate 5 V output path from the power bank to reduce the risk of voltage instability during movement. This gave me a first practical understanding of how actuator loads can influence overall system stability.
- Used a ULN2003 driver stage for the buzzer instead of driving it directly from an Arduino pin, which helped reduce the electrical load on the microcontroller and introduced me to indirect load driving.
- Learned how to identify the row and column structure of the keypad matrix experimentally. I did this by pressing keys one by one and tracing the corresponding connections with a continuity tester, which helped me understand how the keypad wiring related to the software input logic.

### Software and C++

- I noticed early on that some parts of C++ felt familiar because of my previous exposure to Python. Concepts such as arrays, variables, constants, switches, for loops, and functions gave me a starting point, even though the overall structure and syntax were new to me. I also came across `enum class` definitions for the first time and began to understand their role in representing clearly defined system states.
- This project introduced me to programming concepts I had not worked with before, such as classes, structs, and namespaces. It also helped me understand that, unlike in Python, C++ requires variables, function parameters, and return values to be declared with explicit types such as `uint8_t`, `bool`, or `void`.
- I also learned about fixed-width integer types such as `uint8_t`, `uint16_t`, and `uint32_t`, which were completely new to me at the start of the project. Through that, I gained a first understanding of the difference between signed and unsigned integer types and why a developer might choose one over another.
- While working through the codebase, I began to understand how the project software was organized across header files and `.cpp` source files. I learned that header files define interfaces such as declarations, types, and class structure, while the larger function implementations are placed in the corresponding `.cpp` files.
- I was also introduced to access control through `public` and `private` sections in classes. At a basic level, this helped me understand that some parts of a class are intended to be accessible from outside, while others are meant to remain internal to the class itself.
- Another thing I learned was how subsystem-specific files, such as sensor-related headers and source files, are connected to the main program structure and included where they are needed.
- This project also gave me my first practical exposure to the Arduino program structure built around `setup()` and `loop()`. In addition to that, the subsystems in this project were organized with `begin()` functions for initialization and `update()` functions for recurring execution, which helped me understand how initialization and repeated runtime behavior can be separated more clearly.
- Through the `update(uint32_t now_ms)` pattern, I gained a surface-level understanding of non-blocking program flow. I began to see why embedded software often needs regular updates across multiple subsystems without allowing one part of the program to stop the others from running.
- I also encountered C++ keywords such as `inline`, `constexpr`, and `static` for the first time. While my understanding of them is still only basic, I now have at least a first conceptual idea of what role they can play in code structure and behavior.
- Working with structs taught me that they can be useful for grouping related variables into a single, more organized unit. Creating instances of those structs then helped me see how concrete values can be assigned and managed in a clearer way.
- More generally, I gained an entry-level understanding of how objects and instances of user-defined types such as structs and classes are created and used within a larger codebase.
- I also developed a first practical understanding of how actuator control is handled in software. In the servo logic, this included initialization, regular update checks, verifying whether movement was allowed, clamping requested angles to safe limits, counting movements, attaching and detaching the servo, and finally issuing the actual movement command with `.write(angle)`.
- One of the most important things I learned from this project was the difference between understanding what a piece of code does and understanding why it was designed in a certain way. In many places, I can now follow the functional behavior of the code and explain its purpose at a basic level. At the same time, I also became aware that understanding the underlying design decisions, such as why a specific abstraction, class structure, or language feature was chosen, requires a much deeper level of software knowledge. That distinction was one of the most useful lessons from the project for me.

### System Debugging

- Some parts of the system did not work as intended at first, and I had to track down smaller logic mistakes in the code. In a few cases, this meant correcting conditional checks by inverting boolean logic where the original condition did not match the intended behavior.
- I also learned that some subsystem behavior needed additional policy logic beyond the original implementation. For example, the mode control was initially driven only by PV voltage, and I extended it so that simulated leak conditions could also trigger mode changes. In that logic, I made sure that leak handling could escalate the current mode when necessary, but would not incorrectly de-escalate a mode that had already been set by the power conditions.
- Learned how useful targeted serial prints can be for debugging. By printing selected variable values and function calls to the terminal, I was able to check whether certain code paths were reached and what state important variables had at specific moments during runtime.
- I also learned to narrow down faults by commenting out individual functions or subsystem `update()` calls step by step. This helped me reduce the search area when something was not working correctly and made it easier to isolate the source of a problem.
- One of the more important debugging issues was the RFID handling. The MFRC522 library calls I was using introduced too much blocking time in the main loop, which made keypad input less responsive. To investigate that, I traced the relevant timeout behavior inside the `miguelbalboa/MFRC522` library, copied the library into the project tree, and reduced the blocking timeout in the local version. This improved how reliably keypad inputs were registered during normal operation.
- More generally, this part of the project showed me that debugging embedded systems often means looking at both software logic and timing behavior. A problem was not always caused by “wrong code” alone, but sometimes by the way one subsystem affected the responsiveness of the others during runtime.

### Reflection and Known Limitation

- Spent a significant amount of time testing a 4-digit display that was originally intended to show PV voltage continuously. To understand its behavior, I mapped the individual pins and segments experimentally, used resistors for safe testing, and distinguished between common-anode and common-cathode behavior. Although I was eventually able to understand the hardware mapping, I was not satisfied with the display quality and stability in the final setup, especially with regard to flicker. Because of the additional time this was consuming, I decided to remove the display from the active project and archive that part of the code instead.
